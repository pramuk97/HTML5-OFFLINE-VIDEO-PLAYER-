HTML5 OFFLINE VIDEO PLAYER WITH PLAYLIST OPTIONS, WITH DEAFULT SPEED TO 1.5

I am using it for watching downloaded videos and tutotials. Its light weight and below are the some feature I liked.
  
      1. No need to install any third party application.

      2. Default speed is 1.5 you can change it in code to anything you want.

      3. Option to change the speed when you are playing the file.
